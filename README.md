# JavaScript-Timer-Logging-Practice

Simple project with time logging functionality. Uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

This project features a container on the window which saves the current stopwatch time as a new entry.

I built this project to learn about time methods in JavaScript as well as
the setInterval and setTimeout functions.
