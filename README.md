# JavaScript-Timer-Logging-Practice

A web application with time logging functionality. Uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

This project features a container on the window which saves the current stopwatch time as a new entry.

I built this project to learn about time methods in JavaScript as well as
the setInterval and setTimeout functions. (Not the best design, I know...)
